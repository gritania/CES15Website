		<p class="lead" style="margin-left: 20px;"> Airdog won Engadgets best Drone or Robot this year at CES.</p>
		<p class="standard-text">If 2014 was the year that drones entered the (deeper) reaches of the mainstream mindshare (thanks to Amazon, among many other things), then 2015 is the year they start getting put to work. Videography is probably the most obvious consumer application -- evidenced by the sheer number of options. AirDog is one such contender, that offers something the others don't -- a wrist-worn "leash" that makes the drone follow you. Let's be clear, there are other drones that can follow things/people; in fact 3D Robotics made this technology available to everyone through open source. AirDog just took it to the next level, created the leash hardware (other systems use a mobile phone), ramped up the game by adding even more sensors to its craft and designed custom flying "profiles" for different action sports. We took it out for a spin in the Nevada desert to see if it could keep up with a quad bike (spoiler: It did).</p>
		<img src="airdog2.jpg" style = "width: 50%; height: auto; margin: auto; float: left;" alt="..." class="img-rounded">
		<p class="standard-text" style="margin-top: 50px">Sitting atop a quad bike, getting the drone in the air is as simple as a few button pushes on the leash. I say that, but actually AirDog's CEO does it for me. The sun is dipping behind the mountains. We're literally chasing it. Once the drone is up in the air, I pull away, shoot a glance back to make sure it really is following, then open up the throttle. Quad biking doesn't need anything added to make it more fun, but knowing you're getting some sweet video footage really does dial up the enjoyment a few notches. I found myself thinking about what route or maneuvers would make for a cool video, and playing up to the camera. Basically.</p>
